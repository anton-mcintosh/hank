            Based on the following voice memo transcript from an auto technician, create:
            1. A summary of work performed
                * Note: if the audio mentions that this is an estimate, make sure to note that this isn't actually work performed, but work that needs to be performed.
            2. A detailed list of parts used with prices
            3. An estimate of labor hours and cost (assume $50/hour)
            4. A total estimate
            5. If there are recommendations made to the customer to take later, outline these because this is where the customer will read them.
            6. Shoot for 400 words
            7. Don't repeat vehicle information in the summary like VIN or YMM.
